## Story
There has been no progress or discussion about story, tumble suggests having a story evolve with the game, like have the building of the world being the story itself. or maybe have the player crash a boat into the world after creating an account.

All is still up for discussion and due to change.

## Week 1 thoughst
This week has only been a few days but its been a productive week, a few things have been discussed and a working game with networking has been creative, so all in all a good week.


Looking forward for week 2
